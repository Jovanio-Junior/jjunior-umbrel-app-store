# Dennys Umbrel App Store ☂️

This repository contains my custom Umbrel App Store. Unlike the official store, this one is entirely community-driven and independently maintained. It offers apps created and shared by the community, but it is important to note that this store is not affiliated with or supported by the official Umbrel team. All updates, management, and content in this app store are handled independently. I run this App Store just for fun.


🔀 I am open to app suggestions and will do my best to implement them. Additionally, I plan to occasionally submit pull requests to the official Umbrel App repository over time.
